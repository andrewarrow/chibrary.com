    Agreed on a number of levels. The most frustrating and atmosphere
    breaking example I know of is the 2D 'maze' like design of Guild Wars
    where you literally can't fall down a low slope, or really stray from
    the roads. This instantly limited my immersion (along with not being
    able to jump at all (I mean, come on, jumping is a universal videogame
    paradigm!) and made the world seem that much more arbitrary and
    constructed.
    
    An interesting example I was pondering recently (apologies if this is
    too specific) is the recently changed Alterac Valley in WoW.
    
    To set the scene, for those that don't know: this is a huge 40 vs 40
    instanced battleground (i.e. PvP area with objectives). Players earn
    honor for a number of objectives, though the honor earned even for a win
    is small in comparison with the honor required to buy items afterwards
    (~500 for a full win (80-300 for a loss, depending) compared to 12,000
    for an item purchase). It also has an asymmetrical map design.
    
    The problem is two fold- first the need to repeat the games many times
    to earn significant points to purchase rewards. This means players are
    instantly driven to 'grind' the battleground many times and look to
    maximise their honor per hour. This often means games are simply races
    to kill the opposing sides NPC general and win, with little PvP combat
    taking place. This is boring, but efficient, and no fun for the players
    involved. On the opposite end, sometimes games occur with lots of
    interaction, solid base defence and cunning strategies. But even whilst
    enjoying this, there's the nagging feeling of inefficiency - you'd've
    been better off in 3 fast boring games.
    
    The second problem is that you're 40 random people per side. Recently
    Blizzard changed the rules to address the 'race to kill the general'
    problem, forcing players to capture a series of other objectives before
    the enemy general was killable. Only now, still, it's VERY hard to
    encourage players to defend their objectives. Now it's just a race to
    capture them and kill the general as fast as possible. This is despite
    the fact the most EFFICIENT approach has now changed- if 10 people play
    objective defence, they can potentially turn a 50/50 win ratio into a
    90/10 one. But that requires teamwork between random people, something
    exceptionally hard to acheive emergently (even with someone shouting in
    general chat (!), and something the battleground design self-evidently
    still fails to do. "Most" players seem to follow an internal program of:
    "Ressurect at the nearest controlled graveyard -> ride about towards the
    enemy base until I see an opponent -> kill them/die -> back to ride
    about stage/back to graveyard -> go back to step 1". At this level of
    player behaviour, the map asymmetry becomes the deciding factor, since
    it channels players following these rules in ways more favourable to one
    side (the Alliance).
    
    I guess my question is- how do you design an open and objective based
    pvp game, and encourage players into the proper group helping behaviours
    they should be doing? These are ALREADY the optimal behaviours in terms
    of honor/hour but that doesn't seem to be enough. I've often thought
    that it needs a Battlefield 2 style 'commander' role that can actually
    mark the map and 'officially' direct groups of players- it certainly
    works quite well in that game, but then maybe it's a completely
    different mindset.
    
    The interesting thing about Alterac Valley is that it has been changed
    many many times over the last year or so and still doesn't work. And
    Blizzard aren't stupid. Maybe 40 vs 40 PvP 'points' grinding is just
    incompatible with fun/engaging/intelligent gameplay fullstop?

    Actually Guild Wars does exactly this. Well, they do it as a weeklong 
    event, with cities redecorated extra-dark, and the arrival of the Mad 
    King that forces players to do things (and insta-kills those that fails,
     with a resurrect a few seconds later). And pumpkins, and witch-hats,
    and  holiday drinks.
    
    And it works for Guild Wars. Holiday events became something that 
    players like and expect. They also have in-game lore that translates 
    real-life events into the game-world equivalents (Halloween -> Return of
     the Mad King, New Year -> Wintersday, Chinese New Year -> Canthan New
    Year).
    
    I think cruise here overstated his argument, because in my opinion, 
    certain game design decisions simply don't matter. In this example, 
    doing holiday events works. But not doing holiday events also works - it
     will just change the subculture that forms around your game, but will 
    probably not affect the core issues, the principal being the amount of 
    fun your players have. So I'd say that certain -parts- of the game 
    design are hard, and the designers should try to identify those and 
    retain control. For everything else, listening to the players is the 
    obvious thing to do.

    Players seem to know what will be fun -for the immediate short term-.
    Players (and sometimes administrators) might think up something cool
    that works at the time, but detracts from the game experience further
    down the line.
    
    An example that I've experienced: Take a fairly narrow themed world
    (Star Wars or WoW). It's the end of October in real life, what are
    people are thinking about? Halloween. And... y'know what would be
    really cool? If we could have pumpkins in the game. Yeah! And... ghost
    costumes and stuff. Lets make some of those! And we can have witches
    hats (for the female spellcaster types), broomstick and cobweb objects
    that we can put up in houses and stuff. Yeah. How cool is THIS?
    
    Probably quite cool for a few days. But after that you might be left
    wondering "did that really contribute to my game world and the
    background we spend months writing?". Does "seling out" pay out?
    
    Perhaps player activity went up for a couple of weeks. Your bandwidth
    clogged a little. Maybe a reviewer turned up looking for a decent
    roleplay server and turned around straight away when he saw the plastic
    ghoul costmes for sale in the Jedi headquarters.
    
    On the other hand, maybe it did help your game. Perhaps you got a few
    more subscriptions during halloween. Maybe players wiling to pay for
    custom content spent some money. Maybe "selling out" really paid out as
    well.

    I know players who have spent days trying to cross that magical barrier
    or deep chasm (and, having given up and moved on, still come back to
    look at it and think). They wonder if it's part of the game (and if it
    isn't the roleplayers will still pretend it is). Which isn't such a bad
    thing, actually. If your players have an interest in something, feed
    it! Maybe that blank magical barrier will come down one day, or maybe
    someone will "discover" a way to climb down the chasm some time in the
    future.

    Since everyone's run out of things to say, I figured I might as well 
    start another argument :P
    
    It's been stated several times by various people that a game designer 
    shouldn't tell players how to play the game. That players should have 
    the choice to play like they want to.
    
    Now, I'm big on player choice - to me it's one of the fundamentals that 
    makes a game not a movie. Saying that, I'm not sure I can truly agree 
    that a game designer can't tell players how to play the game.
    
    Surely, we're doing that to some extent /just by making the game/. If 
    I'm playing Magic:the Gathering, then I expect a strategic card game - 
    sure I can use the cards to proxy as 40k models, but I'm not playing 
    M:tG anymore, and I can expect anyone who's trying to play M:tG to be 
    rather annoyed.
    
    If I use WoW to produce LotR machinima, then similarly I'm not playing 
    WoW. That isn't "how I want to play WoW." It just isn't WoW.
    
    While taking away all the player's choice means it's no longer a game, 
    limiting them to a certain degree is pretty much the point of making 
    game rules. We should and, I'd say, must, tell the players how to play 
    the game.
    
    Looking at the world around us it becomes patently obvious that people 
    don't make choices that will be best for them. Can I get the hell out of 
    bed in the morning, even though I know it means I get home earlier, and 
    might actually eat this side of 9pm? Heck no. The most enjoyable moment 
    for me in a MMOG was RP'ing in a MUD. Does that mean I RP all the time? 
    Hah! Too much effort, even though a part of me knows it would be 
    well-rewarded.
    
    Players do not know what will be fun. That's why game-design is hard. A 
    good game designer /does/ know better than the players what they will 
    enjoy - if he didn't he wouldn't be a good game designer.
    
    The important caveat, of course, is that players hate to feel like their 
    choices are being deliberately limited - the old "invisible wall" at the 
    edge of a game area, for example, when a chasm would achieve the same 
    effect but not feel forced. I suspect this is what most people object to 
    - not the removal of choices, but the obviousness with which they are 
    removed (such as a "nerf" in MMOG's - having the previous performance to 
    compare to, any such limitation will be obvious).

    Apologies for not replying for a few days - I'd been meaning to post 
    that mail for a while, and only remembered the day I went on holiday...
    
    Okay, general replies, to avoid quote hell:
    
    The Magician's choice doesn't really work well in a game, unless you 
    expect the player to only play through once - the moment they die/reload 
    and make another choice, play through again, or even just discuss the 
    game with a friend, they'll figure out that there were no actual 
    choices. re: the complaints that quests are pointless because they never 
    change the game world of an MMOG.
    
    I was actually expecting more debate over the core statement - I 
    remember quite a few vehemently insisting that they be allowed to play 
    the game how they like - maybe they're on holiday too :P It's certainly 
    the mindset of the players - if you read any board you'll see all sorts 
    of posts complaining that they can't do X, and since they pay their 
    subscription they have a right to be able to do so.
    
    Perhaps the better question, since there appears to be a simple answer 
    to my original one, is how do we prevent players from figuring out that 
    their choices are being restricted when guiding them?
    
    Using James' example - how do you make some players stay and defend an 
    objective, without explicitly immob'ing a random % of the playerbase? To 
    me it seems quite a simple behavioural training problem.
    
    WoW uses rewards to train - do this; gain xp (or honour in this case). 
    In the PvP game, defending an objective isn't immediately connected with 
    the victory, and so is ignored in favour of what the game /is telling 
    them/ will lead to victory (and the reward).
    
    The quick answer is to add honour points to defending an objective (lie, 
    say, TF2) or at the least listing "defend the objective" somewhere 
    obvious when it is in danger, so it becomes associated with the victory 
    in the players' minds.
    
    My preferred solution would be to change the game to encourage players 
    to think further ahead than just immediate rewards. But that's never 
    going to happen, and is a general complaint about most MMOG's today.
    
    Okay, one quote:
    Thus spake Sean Howard:
     >That's why I think we should stop thinking of MMOGs as games. What they

    I think this is definately a better view - you are not producing one 
    "game", but a collection linked by a common theme. Perhaps this is why 
    Puzzle Pirates works so well?

    I'll throw in my two cents so that there is sure to be long thread of
    arguments to follow :)

    Players cannot play a game the way that they like. As per your own
    examples, the second you break fundamental rules, you aren't playing that
    game anymore. There are, of course, secondary, almost optional rules that
    you can break, but don't break the backbone of the game.
    
    That's why I think we should stop thinking of MMOGs as games. What they
    really seem to be are shared environments in which a game (or two or
    three) take place. For instance, in WoW, you could grind up your levels
    and do raids for uber-loot (that's one game), battle in the PvP areas (a
    second game), or just sit around and tell stories around the campfire (not
    a game at all).
    
    Probably the greatest problem facing MMOG designers today is how to
    connect the games they want to be played with the community and the ways
    they want to experience the shared community. My classic example is that a
    solo player may just want to play the game, but forcing them to group to
    play puts them into social situations they might find offensive,
    uncomfortable, or just plain boring. Likewise, social players might want
    to solve problems together in their clique (be it group, family, guild, or
    immediate zone), and even if the game is largely single player, they'll
    still communicate solutions, hints, tips, and exploits to each other
    outside of the game parts.
    
    > Players do not know what will be fun. That's why game-design is hard.
    
    Game design is easy. Have you ever seen some of the successful game
    designers in the game industry? Some of them can barely string two words
    together. Community design (and control) is hard.
    
    Controlling a community is literally a problem as old as life itself.
    We've never figured out how to do it well. We've found ways to make it
    easier on those in power (totalitarian control, like most MMORPGs employ)
    or allow those in the community to have a minor effect on their destiny
    (democracy, republics). But finding that perfect medium where everybody is
    happy is impossible. So the trick is to find the right form of community
    control for the game you are building and the game you want people to
    play. More often than not, totalitarian control is the absolute best
    choice here. You can play the game like you want (within the borders we
    set for you) and you can enjoy the community as you'd like (within the
    borders we set for you). Step outside those borders, and you get banished.
    Do something that makes us uncomfortable, banished. Bring shame to the
    community. Banished. Almost all solutions are exile and very rarely is the
    community rewarded or otherwise have their life improved by "proper"
    behavior.

    In the tabletop RPG world, what is referred to here is a firmly
    established mode of game moderation called "illusionism". If
    railroading is the act of forcing players into specific situations,
    illusionism is the act of doing so while attempting to avoid player
    knowledge of their predicament. It is used for two possible reasons:
    
    1. The game moderator is lazy and/or unable to think on hir feet in
    response to player actions, or
    2. The game moderator believes that the story zie has written will be
    more entertaining to the players than anything the players can come up
    with on their own.
    
    If "found out", an illusionist mode of play usually result in far more
    player resentment than an openly railroading mode of play - players
    feel cheated when they realize the choice they perceived they had was
    not real. Even if players never catch on explicitly, such games rarely
    entertain unless the players have a large amount of buy-in into the
    game moderator's marvelously crafted storyline.
    
    For MMORPGs, the reasons such a technique may be used translate to:
    
    1. The game is technically unable to adjust to player actions, or
    2. The developers believe that the story they have written will be
    more entertaining to the players than anything the players can come up
    with on their own (identical to the tabletop variety).
    
    For #2, I think I can safely claim that no MMORPG has actually
    achieved this, although nearly all of them believe they have. Sure,
    there are (some) people who read the quest flavour text in WoW before
    venturing forth to bravely kill ten ocelots, but outside of easily
    amused fiction-starved early teen kids I can't imagine anyone
    excitedly recount their adventures slaying the giant fire demon of
    Oxz-Gagon from point of view of the game lore, as opposed to in
    meta-game terms. On the other side, many people have awesome stories
    to tell about how they once had a guild Moot in the middle of hostile
    territory, or how they entered the Wetlands by jumping down a series
    of hazardous cliff-side precipices. Simply, the stories players make
    on their own are far more entertaining and sticky than the storyline
    built into the game mythos.
    
    #1 is far more forgivable. A game that attempts to offer a lot of
    player activities and freedom often find themselves in situations
    where the game engine cannot adjust to unpredictable circumstances. As
    an example, look at the economy in EVE Online. In wild 0.0 space, you
    will find all manner of odd market situations, like ridiculously high
    prices on simple shuttlecraft or an complete absence of a particular
    type of common ammunition. Within Empire space, however, the markets
    are tightly regulated. Supply and demand resets each day and
    stockpiles refill regardless of player intervention. This is most
    certainly an invisible wall in the supposedly player-driven EVE
    economy.
    
    But if Empire economy didn't reset, the repercussions would ripple
    throughout the EVE universe. The immediate effect would be that
    newbies would be unable to engage in standard EVE activities of
    manufacturing and trading. The long-term effect would be that certain
    major alliances would start to dominate completely, with little to no
    chance of retaliation. The gameplay of EVE would suffer - and worse,
    it would suffer in a thoroughly unpredictable manner, in uncertain
    ways at an uncertain timeline.
    
    I think that designers can and must inform their players of the game
    modes their game is built to deliver. It doesn't have to be by
    explicit statement - in fact, the best games are those where the
    "correct" mode of play naturally emerges from engaging with it. The
    Alterac Valley is a good example of an incorrect way to inform -
    Blizzard presents it overtly as a new mode of WoW gameplay focusing on
    tactical combat and teamwork, but attaches a reward system which
    informs the players that it is actually just a new currency to grind.
    The gameplay which emerges is one of super-efficient farming rather
    than tense tactical teamwork - objectively less entertaining than the
    mode of play presented overtly. What would happen if Blizzard simply
    removed the Honor reward entirely from the Alterac Valley
    battleground? I imagine that those who chose to engage in that mode of
    play would now be there voluntarily to engage in the form of play
    initially presented by Blizzard - which, obviously, is entirely
    possible to engage in within that space.
    
    But linearity in an MMORPG, I believe, is missing the point entirely.
    The advantage of an MMORPG over a single-player RPG (other than a
    $15/month/subscriber cheque </sarcasm>) is that with other players
    present, one can more easily forge personal stories within the game
    environment due to the infinite number of variables a human element
    offers. Elder Scrolls can only give you so much randomness within the
    scope of its game code, but the presence of other players interacting
    with the environment in dynamic, sticky ways provide a potentially
    endless source of entertainment. When designers figure this out,
    instead of offering fake choices and (warning: convergent analogies
    ahead) herding players through their rollercoaster museum, maybe we
    can get *real* entertainment from mainstream MMORPGs.

    And once again, I'm reminded of tabletop RPGs, where the same argument
    has been raised repeatedly with little to no consensus within the
    hobby.
    
    Should a set of game rules only simulate reality, letting the
    individuals who play it (mostly the game moderator) infer whatever
    meaning they wish within the game constraints? (GURPS)
    Or should a set of game rules hint at the fun factor by strongly
    emphasizing a particular piece of the game, thereby leading the
    players towards engaging mostly in that activity? (D&D / d20, Spirit
    of the Century, etc)
    
    In reality, the lines aren't that distinct. Many tabletop gamers use
    d20 rules to simulate reality and hardly ever use the rules the game
    was built around, which (arguably) is miniature combat. In my humble
    opinion, this often leads to the "Alterac Valley" problem, where the
    reward system imposed by the rules of the games clash with the
    gameplay attempted by the participants.

    This is the GURPS stance, and one which (like tabletop RPGs) many
    MMO's claim to do. "Be anything, do anything!" is the prevalent
    marketing line. Well, there is but one MMO I'm aware of that lets you
    do this, and that is Second Life. The thing with Second Life, if
    you're not really into graphical chat clients, there's not a lot there
    - like Sean says, it's not a game. It's up to you to infer meaning,
    and your own concept of what you're doing there is more than likely to
    clash with someone else's before long.
    
    On the other hand, a game which strongly hints at an underlying
    premise is likely to have less pitfalls of this kind. By its nature,
    it's not as flexible and might not attract as many initial
    subscribers. On the other hand, those subscribers that do join are
    likely to be the target audience for the game, and won't engage in
    activities that clash with other subscribers' ideas of what the game
    is about.
    
    As a simple example, take the (tabletop) game "Sorcerer". Sorcerer has
    a very explicit premise. You cannot be anyone doing anything; you are
    a sorcerer, and you engage in the summoning of demons. In emergent
    play, the game is about your relationships with those demons, what
    engaging with demons does to you, and how far you are willing to go in
    your quest for power. For this reason, the game strongly de-emphasizes
    your character's own abilities, choosing instead to focus on the
    intricacies of demonic summoning, the strength of demonic bonds, the
    lengths demons will go to to get their ways, the powers demons might
    infer onto their summoner, and so on.
    
    Nobody who knows the game will approach it thinking "Cool, I'm going
    to totally summon all the demons I can, get awesome super-powers and
    get everyone to worship me!" - or if they do, they will most
    definitely change their mind after playing a session or two. Instead,
    one would approach it as "Cool, I'm going to totally summon all the
    demons I can, get in a lot of trouble with controlling them all, and
    then have to clean up the mess - and how do I do that without
    summoning more of them?". One approaches a game of Sorcerer *knowing*
    the game is about getting in, or staying out of, trouble - not about
    pumping your stats to the max and boasting to your friends.
    
    Similarly, WoW implicitly states "You get to be a hero! Nothing you do
    within the scope of this game is crippling - the only way is up! The
    point of the game is to get more powerful than everyone else, and show
    it off!"
    CoX states "The point of the game is to get an avatar that looks
    really, really awesome! As you get more powerful, we give you more
    costumes and cooler looking flashy powers!"
    EVE Online states "The point of the game is to get rich beyond your
    wildest dreams, and use your riches to make your organization win!"
    
    The crux: the moment you try to add multiple premises to a game, you
    muddle the idea of what the game is about. This causes friction within
    the community, which now have differing goals within the game. You can
    choose to collect and wear cool-looking armour in WoW, but the game
    system punishes you for your choice - a mismatched set with less
    inspiring textures may provide better stats. You can explore
    tremendous vistas in WoW, but if you venture out beyond your abilities
    you're likely to get eaten by the first mob that shows up. You can
    assault and kill off all guards and quest givers in hostile towns in
    WoW, but the server resets the state, so there is little to no payoff
    beyond boasting rights. You can go to Alterac Valley and battle random
    hostiles for Honor, but because the reward system is broken you may as
    well lose - as long as you do it quickly.
    
    In tabletop RPGs, a game moderator is always present and only have to
    deal with 2-8 other players. A skilled moderator can make a GURPS-like
    system work for them and get everyone on the same page with regards to
    the premise of the game.
    
    MMORPGs are 99% auto-moderated by the system itself. As such, an MMO
    that offers a plethora of premises to tens of thousands of
    simultaneous players runs into a vast array of community management
    problems, where players looking for vastly different forms of gameplay
    from the same base set of rules gripe about why the game isn't more
    like *this* or *that*. No wonder solo play has been so successful in
    modern mass-market MMORPGs, whereas those games that feature clearly
    defined premises have far tighter communities, easier grouping, and
    relaxed and polite conversation on boards and in-game chat.
    
    So for my 2c, if it wasn't obvious - I'm looking forward to seeing a
    plethora of MMOs with smaller subscriber bases and tighter, better
    defined game play. Anything less, when you're dealing with a largely
    computer moderated community of people, is simply too much to bite off
    for anyone but the biggest players, and I pity those community
    managers.

    Indeed.  One of my fun sidelines in WoW during the beta period was  
    wall climbing--I have screenshots of my avatar in all sorts of  
    unlikely places.  Examples:

    Perhaps because I am so keen on the phenomenon, I point the finger at mixing
    of player groups.  World of Warcraft only has one PvP game for levels 51-60
    and 61-70, correct?  Anyone who is motivated to PvP for any reason goes to
    Alterac Valley at those levels.  But those players have a variety of goals.
    
    Unreal Tournament addressed this very intelligently by creating multiple PvP
    games.  There is free-for-all PvP, team PvP, and the team goal-directed PvP
    called Onslaught (my favorite) - plus others that don't come to mind.
    Players interested in each type of PvP have an outlet, helping to ensure
    that everyone in any given style of game is there to experience that style
    of game.
    
    I use the phrase "let like-minded players play together".  Not a catchy
    statement, but the point is that games need to create not only their own
    favorite form of entertainment, but also as many variations as they can
    technically handle - and then let like-minded players get together to play
    those variations.  I believe that Raph Koster's Metaverse project will
    address some of this.  The result may well be so many variations on
    multiplayer games that you'll be able to find a game that has the
    entertainment that you like.  Today, we have lots and lots of people
    converging on a few forms of entertainment, trying to get *their* preferred
    entertainment out of it.
    
    I use the example of the guy dancing naked in the middle of the street while
    a bunch of roleplayers walk past, discussing the need for mobilization of
    their mining conglomerate.  The two may well be incompatible, but they have
    to coexist because there's one standard game mechanic that happens to
    support both styles of play.  In PvP, the players interested in the
    entertainment of getting into fights or of ganking any available victims are
    looking for an experience that is different from the team-goal-oriented
    players.  In Alterac Valley, they have to play in the same space.

    The only argument you'll get from me on that is the potential for
    misinterpreting 'tell'.  I doubt you're after a "do this" and "do that"
    mindset.  I would guess that a notion of 'inviting' is actually more
    appropriate than 'telling'.  Perhaps 'tempting', even.  For the achievers:
    'daring'.

    I'm reminded of a bit of wisdom dropped on this list years ago that
    designers should never give anything to players that they are going to take
    away.  That is perhaps the easiest way to get players thinking that a
    certain thing would be fun to do that's not actually in the game.  Giving it
    to a player tell him that it is fun.  Taking it away means that the player
    now *knows* that it was fun and they can no longer reach it.
    
    The invisible wall is the same deal.  If player expectations are guided into
    the belief that characters can go everywhere and do everything that the
    player sees, then when the character hits an invisible wall, the player will
    feel that some entertainment that could have been obtained on the other side
    of the wall is unavailable.  They got their hopes up and the designer dashed
    them.
    
    So I would claim that it's not an issue of removal so much as an overall
    pattern of designers walking players into dead ends in the structure of
    their entertainment.  Imagine if there was a den of progressively more
    difficult monsters, and a group is fighting their way to the climax of the
    encounter when they enter a cavernous room and...
    
    They find a couple of standard NPC merchants.

    In reply to cruise's post regarding player choice:
    
    There is something called "The Magician's Choice".
    This is when the magician seems to offer an audience member a choice,
    but phrases the offer in such a way that the magician actually forces
    the choice in a certain direction.
    
    For example:
    1. The magician asks the audience member to choose one of two cards.
    2.1. If the audience member chooses the left card, the magician chops
    it in half and hands the right card to the audience member.
    2.2. If the audience member chooses the right card, the magician hands
    the right card to the audience member and chops the left card in half.
    
    Malcolm Gladwell (quoting Ian Rowling) gives a similar example,
    regarding the art of cold reading.
    1. The cold reader says "you don't work with children, do you?"
    2.1. The audience member says "No, I don't." The cold reader goes on
    "No, I thought not."
    2.2. The audience member says "Actually, I do." The cold reader goes
    on "Yes, I thought so."
    
    The point that I'm trying to make is that making a choice is a
    sensation; a sensation that movies do not offer.
    
    Games can be linear, while still offering pleasure in a different way
    than a movie.

    No argument there - I was expecting a little more resistance :P 
    Certainly you don't want to over-regulate everything.

    This is the challenge - walking that fine line.
    
    The player created stories are the ones they feel emotionally attached 
    to, and so will always be far more rewarding and involving than any you 
    can script. Your game needs to offer a framework in which the players 
    can create their own stories.
    
    But, and this is the trick, to be really enjoyable, they still have to 
    good stories. "I completely dominated those 10 giant rats!" really won't 
    cut it. "I totally pwned that n00b" is equally banal.
    
    The current games positively encourage taking the easiest route, rather 
    than facing difficult challenges which provide narrow victories (or even 
    losses) - people's natural inclination is opposite to that which is 
    generally the most fulfilling, and the grind simply re-inforces that.
    
    The context and type of that challenge will vary from person to person, 
    as John Buehler and Lachek Butalek eloquently explained - either better 
    division within games, or smaller, more focused games. But within any of 
    them, the player needs to be guided as invisibly as possible away from 
    the low-hanging fruit.

    I completely agree, but there is an element of the gaming community that
    believes quite strongly that the very friction that we implicitly declare as
    undesirable is a good and necessary thing.  They enjoy the times when
    agendas conflict.  From what I recall of Nick Yee's research, players who
    really enjoy PvP constitute perhaps a quarter of the MMO player population.
    And I don't think they care if the character that they're acting against is
    a PvP enthusiast or not.

    I look forward to a proper partitioning of game experiences.  It may be that
    a large number of small MMOs is the way to go, but I hold out hope that an
    MMO can become like a theme park, with many activities available that
    clearly communicate the entertainment that a player will find in them.
    
    I wonder how much of the difficulty is the graphics.  The graphics display
    the MMO environment as a virtual world.  There are animals walking around
    the forests, there are lamp posts, lights in the windows, birds singing and
    so on.  What player wouldn't assume that they could do anything?  And then
    there's the attempt to create dynamics of interaction between various
    systems such as crafting, socializing and killing.  That interdependence
    actively brings together conflicting agendas.

    Yes, except that the one that needs to be trained is the designer.
    
    The thing that designers need to understand is that if they present their
    entertainment properly, it will attract players who want that entertainment.
    As I mentioned in another post, if all players interested in PvP have
    exactly one bit of entertainment to turn to, they will use it to their best
    ability to get what they want out of it.  A game that promises everything to
    everyone will get a wide distribution of players, with a wide set of
    agendas.  Whatever they want to do, they will pursue to the best of the
    game's abilities.  Designers look at the results and begin to ponder how
    they can take a mishmash player base and bend their wills to the goals that
    they had in the first place.
    
    Create an experience in your game that players can look at, understand the
    source of the entertainment and then choose to play or not.  Don't try to
    change your players.

    I believe that MMOs are best suited to being a collection of loosely-related
    games.  If I were building an MMO, I'd build a theme park MMO where the
    games are not related at all.  As I built experience with that, I'd start to
    see how I could relate them in some way.

    Indeed, and those events are quite fun (I was a bit annoyed to get a  
    mummy mask instead of a witch hat this year, but that's how the cookie  
    crumbles).
    
    However, and this is very, very important: Guild Wars has a story arc  
    as a sideline.  A good one, and a fun one (I'm still not all the way  
    through it), but NCsoft understands, accepts, and supports the fact  
    that the main draw is the PvP metagame (and not just for cash prizes,  
    though I suspect that helps).  The holiday events, the occasional  
    weekend mini-events, and so on work precisely because immersion is not  
    the main point of the game (though it can be quite immersive).
    
    And boy howdy is GW fun to play.

    ArenaNet doesn't publish the statistics, but forum polls suggest
    relatively even split among the forum readers. However, this is heavily
    biased, as competitive gameplay used to be the main endgame for Guild
    Wars, so it's played by more experienced players, and those are much
    more likely to visit and vote on the forums. Also, there is a
    significant overlap between the communities, due to the existence of a
    VERY casual-friendly PvP mode (namely, Alliance Battles).
    
    I tend to use Baldur's Gate for comparison when people ask me what Guild
    Wars is like, actually. You run 1 main character but can take a number
    of NPCs which you can also partially control. AI is surprisingly
    competent if you don't feel like doing any micromanagement, and this
    makes the game mostly soloable - but Hard Mode is way more difficult to
    play this way, as Hard Mode monster AI also becomes surprisingly
    competent in wiping your party. Obviously, you can also play with full
    human parties. Also, duo mode is quite popular among friends - 2 humans,
    with 3 NPCs each (I've seen some family groups playing this way,
    including husband/wife and even father/son).

    Since Guild Wars doesn't have level grind, the plot -is- the game.
    Except in the first campaign, you level up to 20 (max level) and max
    your gear as soon as you leave the tutorial area, and the entire
    non-tutorial game is max level, max gear progression through the
    storyline, with side quests. Grind is done for prestige items and
    titles. Both primary quests/missions and side quests tend to be
    surprisingly well written; for a game driven by the plot, this is a
    must. Quote from a developer:
    
    | The other dictum we carried with us into the development of GW:EN
    | was that quests should be varied and fun. We wanted to avoid 
    | designing any delivery (or ?fedex?) quests at all. In fact, we put
    | a sign on the door to the quest design area that said: ?Every time 
    | you make a fedex quest, Abaddon will feast on puppy eyes.? We want
    | the quests in Eye  of the North to present players with new goals,
    | new challenges, and new ways to play | the game.
    
    Note that GW:EN is the last release of Guild Wars (they're now doing
    Guild Wars 2), and note that the quests in the older Guild Wars aren't
    far from this standard, either; they (usually) tend to have multiple
    stages and variety of goals to complete.
    
    On the downside, most players don't even try to roleplay, which is
    actually not to far from how single-player Baldur's Gate is played.
    Still, there is a small, tight community of game lore collectors and
    roleplaying guilds. There were a small number of player-ran events, and
    ArenaNet provided coding support for some of them (each time this was a
    welcome surprise to the community). Also, a number of NPCs were named
    after active posters on the Lore forums. So I'd say that GW falls
    halfway between a grind MMORPG and a MUD in this respect, for the people
    who choose to RP.
    
    The main weakness of GW is the endgame. After getting through the plots
    and quests of all the chapters, you have a very definite What Now?
    moment. PvP is the obvious answer. Originally, the plan was to also push
    out a new campaign every 6-9 months, but that didn't quite work as
    planned (hence, move to Guild Wars 2) - the important (but not the only)
    stumbling point was that they decided to add new classes and a bunch of
    new skills for each campaign; this caused HUGE issues for the PvP
    balance, as it takes longer than 6 months to balance all the new stuff
    that the -previous- chapter introduced. Since balanced PvP that demands
    HUGE level of strategy and skill was one of the stated goals of GW, Anet
    seems to be searching for the new model of expanding the content and
    selling chapters.
    
    Other endgame options, such as Hard Mode and prestige title grind do
    exist, but they were added over time and are not really the part of the
    original game. Still, they seem to keep most of the playerbase
    interested enough to wait out GW1-GW2 gap; even though they were
    originally added only to help people tide out chapter-to-chapter gap.
    
    Considering that one of the stated goals of GW design was to break as
    many cliches that Everquest set as canon as possible, I'd say that the
    above does set a new game design, with well-defined rules and
    principles; ArenaNet followed this design (mostly) successfully. But for
    now I'll refrain from trying to formalise the rules they set.

    I do like this approach. If you're going to be spammed with players
    wishing each other Happy Halloweeen, then it's not a bad idea to listen
    to what they're interested in and meet (surpass?) their wishes. 
    
    Then there are other more in-game events. Discworld MUD has a (roughly)
    annual Witching Trial, where players compete to appear to be the best
    witch (a game of psychology rather than anything else).
    
    Whilst I haven't played Guild Wars, I do appreciate a game with a
    proper plot. Does anyone happen to know the ratio of competitive team
    players vs co-operative team players? I'd be interested in knowing. As
    I understand it, playing co-operatively is akin to playing a
    single-player game, with several players (c.f. Baldur's Gate).
    
    How important is background plot to players? One interesting
    side-effect of worlds with smaller player bases (MUDs generally) is the
    chance to get your own name in the history books. Unlike WoW, The
    Matrix Online and Guild Wars, if the player base is only ~10,000, and
    the number of truly active, involved players is ~500, there's actually
    a very good chance that you'll be able to take part (or even lead) a

    The back story is deeper than I expected going into it, but yeah, RP  
    (that is, playing in persona) is almost non-existent.
    
    My personal theory about this ("I have a theory, and it is mine") is  
    that as the VR aspects get more immersive, the incentive for RP  
    drops.  You no longer have to paint pictures in your mind's eye from  
    the DM's description or a paragraph of text--it's all just there.
    
    I've noticed this in real-life RP as well.  I'm a long-time SCA  
    member, but the level of realism I experience today is much greater  
    than it was 25 years ago.  Today, if I sit down with a piece of  
    parchment, a goose quill cut into a pen, and grind up some ink, I'm  
    not "re-enacting", I'm just doing calligraphy.  When a friend of mine  
    builds a tatara and smelts iron sand into steel ingots and then forges  
    tools and knives out of it, he's not "role playing" blacksmithing,  
    he's just blacksmithing.
    
    Similarly, modern games have gotten immersive enough that RP isn't  
    really required--you just play (note how "immersivity" has dropped  
    steadily as a topic on Mud-Dev over the years...).  Whether this is a  
    success or a failure is, of course, open to debate.

    This isn't a problem with areas, but a problem with your level/loot 
    system. The way rewards are handled needs to change, which is a whole 
    'nother topic that has been round and around on this list many times :P

    Instancing + procedural generation is one solution. Generating the world 
    based on the player that activates the portal, owns the key, casts the 
    teleport spell, etc. means they get the same world each time (your 
    procedural generation is repeatable given the same input, right?), but 
    it's unique to them.
    
    If the game gave easy access to the history and accomplishments of a 
    player, then people don't have to "reveal" the secret location for 
    people to know they've been there. CoX's "badge system" includes 
    exploration badges for reaching a certain area - a similar system lets 
    others know you've fought your way to the undersea city through the 
    caverns of uber-doom-ness, without you having to tell them where the 
    secret entrance to the caverns actually is.
    
    Player housing is also an attempt, on a smaller scale, of this. Players 
    get to control and own their own, if small, part of the game world.

    I don't know the ratio, but there appear (from a player's point of  
    view) to be two major communities, each of which is well supported by  
    the game:
    
    - Single-player or cooperative storyline RPG, punctuated with towns  
    where you can sell your ph4t l3wt and upgrade your gear.  There's also  
    explorer and achiever sidelines, where you can get special titles for  
    exploring every inch of the world or doing every quest (neither is  
    necessary to follow the storyline, and in fact for alternate  
    characters, once you know your way around the world, you can run  
    through abbreviated versions of the story arcs).   Once you complete  
    the arc, you can go back and do it in "hard mode", which brings much  
    of the alleged excitement of raids to the game ;-).
    
    One interesting aspect is that single-player play is not highly  
    penalized compared to grouping--it's quite possible to log in, pick a  
    set of "henchmen", and run a mission during your lunch hour.  It's  
    also possible to group with friends (and given the level cap, you all  
    end up at level 20 soon enough that there's no "level skew" to prevent  
    it--levels 1-20 are basically just a tutorial :-)).
    
    - Team based PvP: Either after doing the RP arc, or after simply  
    creating a max-level PvP-only character, you drop right into a variety  
    of squad-based PvP "twitchy" games, including a ranked ladder with  
    monetary prizes.  This amounts to RPG graphics with almost FPS style  
    gameplay--nonstop go-go-go CTF, tower defense, or just "most # of  
    kills" duels.
    
    There's some overlap between the two groups, in a couple ways:
    - The RPG story arc can unlock elite skills that can be used in PvP  
    (or you can just buy an unlock kit)
    - Good PvPers (or RPGers, for that matter) can make good in-game money  
    doing "runs" for people or groups through the harder RPG missions.  A  
    particular route through the map ("The Droknar Run") is very  
    profitable to people who can lead a run through it.
    
    However, someone who wants just straight squad PvP doesn't have to  
    deal with the RP side at all, and someone who just wants to experience  
    the story doesn't have to deal with PvP.  It works pretty well.
    
    > How important is background plot to players?
    
    Differs widely.  I like it a lot.  The world-building, graphics,  
    musical score, and RP story plots are actually quite good (much better  
    than WoW, though WoW is better for big raiding--GW maxes out at 8  
    players per team), and the rewards from the story quests don't involve  
    much grinding.

    In GW, fame isn't reflected in the storyline, but it *is* reflected in  
    the guild ladder, the monetary (and hardware) prizes, etc. Rather than  
    have people hijack the RP storyline, there's an explicit "sports  
    league" outlet for this, complete with seasons, the ability to watch  
    matches, wager on the outcomes, etc.

    Right. And I bet there's a micro-community of players like yourself who
    specialise in such activities. Who can find a way to stand on top of
    Mount Hyjal first? Prove that it's possible to stand on top of
    Blackrock Spire, etc.
    
    A couple of years ago a player friend of mine made a comment about the
    world we were in at the time, "It's not as empty as it used to be". I
    didn't think that much of it at the time. One of the "games" that she
    enjoyed was going places where other people didn't. Unfortunately in
    any world that's been online for a while, the Super-Secret Dungeon of
    Bubba, hidden beneath the lake, will no longer be a secret, and there
    will be a well-worn path there by players who want to raid it and get
    the exclusive loot that the area offered.
    
    So we try to expand our MMORPG worlds as much as possible. Hire another
    builder/scriptwriter, slap in a couple of new areas at the edge of the
    map. That impassable mountain pass? It's open now, you can get to the
    barbarian village. The maze-like swamp, if you can get through it, now
    has a secret exit at the end , behind the lizard king's throne. You can
    get to the underworld from there. Great! More areas to explore!
    
    But like the construction of roads and motorways, if the capacity
    exists, people will use it. Your new areas will become just as
    populated as the rest of the world, partly by the casual players
    exploring, but also by the more hardcore contingent working their way
    through the grind. There are plenty of players who sign in, buff
    themselves up, and automatically make their way to:
    
    - Area A (where the easiest monsters with the best pHaT l3wT) to see if
    anyone has raided it recently. If it has, in 60 seconds, they can be at
    the edge of
    - Area B (which may well be on the other side of the continent, but has
    only marginally less l3wT than Area A). After that, it's
    - Area C then
    D.
    - Area E if convenient, or then on to
    - Area F. By that time, Area A has probably respawned, so stop by
    - Area G on the way, and then grind through
    - Area A and
    - B again. 
    
    I know a couple of places that have experimented with methods of
    deliberately restricting particular areas of the MMORPG, to make them
    feel a bit more exclusive and deserted. Players like to know about
    secret (profitable?) areas. They also like to make themselves look good
    by -telling other players- about secret areas, and -showing them- the
    secret areas. But, bizarrely, at the end of the day, they don't want
    other players to -actually go there- because then it wouldn't be their
    secret.
    
    Setting aside restrictions that are put in place on certain areas for
    "premium" paying customer-players, I thought I'd open up this topic for
    discussion.

    Agreed.  Not only is the temptation fading, but the opportunities are
    lessening as well.  I find the trend towards realism somewhat
    counter-productive.  Those who want an alternate life in a virtual world
    welcome it.  I know that I find it rather distasteful.  It's taking the fun
    out of gaming, completely independent of role-playing.
    
    When I play Chess, I don't want the pieces battling it out realistically,
    leaving blood and bodies all over the board.  Abstraction can be a nice
    thing.
