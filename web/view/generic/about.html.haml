%h1 About Chibrary

%p
  Chibrary is named for its home in Chicago (and thus pronounced "shy-brary").
  Chibrary provides free, highly-readable public mailing list archiving. If you
  run a list, we'd be happy to archive it for you.
%p
  Chibrary is only an archive, it does not produce or exercise editorial
  control over the messages it archives.
%p
  Chibrary is dedicated to the memory of Aaron Swartz.

%h2 Adding a new list
%a{ name: 'add' }
%p
  Email <b>contact+add@</b> this domain with:
%ul
  %li The full name of the list (eg "Linux Kernel")
  %li A slug we can use in URLs (eg "<a href="/linux-kernel">linux-kernel</a>")
  %li
    A short and informative description of the list for people who have
    never heard of you before. HTML is OK.
  %li The homepage URL for the project or main topic of discussion (eg. http://kernel.org)
  %li The URL for the mailing list (eg. http://vker.kernel.org)
%p
  It should just be a few days before a human adds your list.
-# %p
  Afterwards, subscribe the address <b>archive@</b> this domain to your mailing
  list. Incoming messages will be saved, but it may be a day or two before a
  human here confirms the list should appear.

%h2 Importing archives
%p
  We can import your old messages and provide the history of your list. Create a
  tarball/zip of one message per file or Unix mbox files. Email
  <b>contact+import@</b> this domain with a URL for us to download the file --
  <strong>do not attach the archive</strong> to your email. We cannot accept
  other formats, and forwarding old messages won't work.

%h2 Preventing archiving
%p
  Chibrary respects the all the anti-archiving standards as broadly as
  possible, so you can request that your emails go unarchived by setting any of
  the following headers in your email client:
%dl
  %dt Archive
  %dd to contain 'no'
  %dt X-Archive
  %dd to anything
  %dt X-No-Archive
  %dd to contain 'yes'
-# %p
  If you would like to remove your already-archived messages, email
  <b>contact+remove@</b> this domain from the address on the message with your
  full name and mailing address and a link to the exact email you want removed
  (click on the date in the header of the message).

%h2 Using Chibrary
%a{ name: 'help' }
%p
  On month pages, you can click to the right of thread subjects to see a full
  list of messages in the thread. Double-click to toggle all of the thread
  lists.
%p
  Thread lists show their subject once at the top and to the right of a message
  only when someone changes it.
%p
  Keyboard shortcuts make reading threads even easier:
%dl
  %dt j/k

  %dt i
  %dd Jump to the message that this one is <b>I</b>n Reply To
  %dt n/p
  %dd Next/previous thread

  %dd Toggle the quotes in this message or all messages

%h2 Spam

%p
  Mailing list archives are spam-filtered, but we occasionally miss some. We
  obfuscate all email addresses to prevent spammers from harvesting them from
  Chibrary. If you are a spammer, please die in a fire.

%h2 Contact
%p
  Email <b>contact@</b> this domain for all other inquiries. A human should get
  back to you within a day or two at most.
