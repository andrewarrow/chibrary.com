  Sorry, I just noted that you (Jester) had already put up your
  design. I see others already pointed out some of the ways players
  will abuse it via mules, etc.

  My major comment, though, is that I apparently misunderstood your
  aim.  This isn't a justice system. It's a system for complicating
  PK. For instance, in this system, I could in-role rape you (via
  emotes or whatever), you could kill me for it, and I'm suddenly the
  victim, able to take out a bounty on you. This is what I meant about
  systems like this just being a new way to grief people.
  Fundamentally, your code will never be capable of recognizing what
  most people recognize as 'justice.' Human admin/judges are one
  solution, but have their own problems, all of which are seen in your
  typical 3rd world justice systems.

  Huh?  At the first signs of butchering, the guards would immediately
  approach offenders, restrain them, and escort them from the city.
  As to harassment or mudrape, I'm assuming that citizens would still
  have an "ignore" option available to them.  In addition, I don't
  think it gets too complicated to say that the
  Justicar/Governor/President/Monarch can issue an orange flag in
  addition to being able to remove them.  Perhaps he can even
  designate others who have the ability to issue what is basically a
  city ban.  In fact, I would think the Ruler would be able to label
  and entire external community with orange flags if such was
  desireable, thus putting that community at war with his own.  In any
  case, even without any of these extra rules, under the original
  system you described, the citizens could still kill the offender and
  then petition to have the flag they received for their action
  removed by the Justicar.

  I'm not saying Player Justice isn't difficult, but I am saying that,
  properly implemented, I believe it offers additional methods for
  dealing with injustice that can be useful for offloading some of the
  work-load from admins, giving players a feeling of responsibility
  and ownership for their own community, and making for a more
  interesting game.
