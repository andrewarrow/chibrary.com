  Subject: [MUD-Dev] The last days of Discord PVP server on EQ
  
  In December EQ opened a new PVP server with a new set of rules. The
  server is called Discord and is part of a promotional campaign for
  the new EQ expansion. This server will end tomorrow.
  
  The server has a level limit of 50 and includes only the old world
  stuff.  Players start at level 1 and become PVP-ready at level 6.
  If any player dies for any reason, they go back to level 1 and lose
  everything in the bank.  If a player kills another player, the
  killer gets to loot everything from the victim.  The experience
  gained from mob kill is about twice normal so leveling is faster
  than normal even with crappy gear.
  
  Darkenbane, a PVP guild, has posted a few articles
  
    http://www.darkenbane.com/
  
  about their experience on Discord including how the alliances
  evolved from a free-for-all world to race alliancies and finally to
  a large common alliance.
