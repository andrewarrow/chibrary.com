What are ThreadLists even *for*?

Well, I store messages under their call numbers (formerly message IDs) and
when you load a month page you want to see all the threads - info that
includes subjects, authors, and dates for all the threads started in that
month.

It seems to just be an index - a workaround for the fact that I couldn't
quickly fetch many. The Riak 2i may solve that.

Though I don't want to load full Emails when I only need author, date,
subject, and call_number.

It also includes redirect information, so folks trying a call number that's
been reparented end up in the right thread.

Should this just be a cache method or two on MessageStorage?

The next/previous thread stuff is complex enough. But I guess ThreadList
is going to get pretty thin as most everything moves to ThreadListStorage.

Do I need some kind of thread by date index? (I am reimplementing so much
basic database functionality.)

After working with this code a few hours, I think ThreadList really just needs
to be a map of the ThreadSet data structure, replacing Messages with Summary
versions that only include call_number, n_subject, and date. The whole
Container tree is the structure, and it works with Messages or Summaries.
