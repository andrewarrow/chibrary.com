<P><HR><P>

<P> In this document, I describe what is, in my humble but correct
opinion, the best known algorithm for threading messages (that is,
grouping messages together in parent/child relationships based on which
messages are replies to which others.)  This is the threading algorithm
that was used in Netscape Mail and News 2.0 and 3.0, and in
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel/">Grendel</A>.

<P> Sadly, my C implementation of this algorithm is not available,
because it was purged during the 4.0 rewrite, and Netscape refused to
allow me to free the 3.0 source code.

<P> However, my Java implementation is available in the
<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/19981201194338/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel/">Grendel</A>
source.  You can find a descendant of that code on
<A HREF="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/grendel/">ftp.mozilla.org</A>.
Here's the original source release:
<A HREF="../hacks/grendel-1998-09-05.tar.gz">grendel-1998-09-05.tar.gz</A>;
and a later version, ported to more modern Java APIs:
<A HREF="../hacks/grendel-1999-05-14.tar.gz">grendel-1999-05-14.tar.gz</A>.
The threading code is in <TT>view/Threader.java</TT>. See also
<TT>IThreadable</TT> and <TT>TestThreader</TT>. 
(The <A HREF="mailsum.html">mailsum code</A> in
<TT>storage/MailSummaryFile.java</TT> and the MIME parser in the
<TT>mime/</TT> directory may also be of interest.)

<P> This is not the algorithm that Netscape 4.<I>x</I> uses, because
this is <A HREF="mailsum.html">another</A> area where the 4.0 team 
screwed the pooch, and instead of just continuing to use the existing
working code, replaced it with something that was bloated, slow, 
buggy, and incorrect.  But hey, at least it was in C++ and used 
databases!

<P> This algorithm is also described in the 
<!-- <A HREF="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-imapext-thread-09.txt"> -->
<A HREF="draft-ietf-imapext-thread-12.txt">
<B>imapext-thread</B></A>
Internet Draft: Mark Crispin and Kenneth Murchison formalized my
description of this algorithm, and propose it as the 
<FONT SIZE="-1">THREAD</FONT> extension to the 
<A HREF="http://www.imap.org/"><FONT SIZE="-1">IMAP</FONT></A> protocol
(the idea being that the <FONT SIZE="-1">IMAP</FONT> server could give
you back a list of messages in a pre-threaded state, so that it
wouldn't need to be done on the client side.)  If you find my
description of this algorithm confusing, perhaps their restating of it
will be more to your taste.


<P> I'm told this algorithm is also used in the
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-office/evolution.shtml">Evolution</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.balsa.net/">Balsa</A> mail readers.
Also, Simon Cozens and Richard Clamp have written a
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/author/RCLAMP/Mail-Thread/Thread.pm">
Perl</A> version; Frederik Dietz has written a
<A HREF="https://github.com/fdietz/jwz_threading">Ruby</A> version; and
Max Ogden has written a
<A HREF="https://github.com/maxogden/conversationThreading-js">JavaScript</A>
version.  (I've not tested any of these implementations, so I make no
claims as to how faithfully they implement it.)

<P><HR WIDTH="50%"><P>

<P> First some background on the headers involved.

<DL>

<DT><B>In-Reply-To:</B></DT>
<DD>

<P> The In-Reply-To header was originally defined by
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</A>,
the 1982 standard for mail messages.  In 2001, its definition
was tightened up by
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</A>.

<P> <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</A> defined
the In-Reply-To header as, basically, a free-text header.  The syntax
of it allowed it to contain basically any text at all.  The following
is, literally, a legal RFC 822 In-Reply-To header:

<P><UL>
<B>In-Reply-To:</B><I> thirty-five ham and cheese sandwiches</I>
</UL>

<P> So you're not guaranteed to be able to parse anything useful
out of In-Reply-To if it exists, and even if it contains something
that looks like a Message-ID, it might not be (especially since
Message-IDs and email addresses have identical syntax.)

<P> However, most of the time, In-Reply-To headers do have something
useful in them.  Back in 1997, I grepped over a huge number of messages
and collected some damned lies, I mean, statistics, on what kind of 
In-Reply-To headers they contained.  The results:

<UL>

</UL>

<P> Of course these numbers are very much dependent on the sample set,
which, in this case, was probably skewed toward Unix users, and/or
toward people who had been on the net for quite some time (due to
the age of the archives I checked.)

<P> However, this seems to indicate that it's not unreasonable to
assume that, if there is an In-Reply-To field, then the first 
&lt;&gt;-bracketed text found therein is the Message-ID of the
parent message.  It is safe to assume this, that is, so long as 
you still exhibit reasonable behavior when that assumption turns
out to be wrong, which will happen a small-<WBR>but-<WBR>not-<WBR>insignificant
portion of the time.

<P> <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</A>, the
successor to <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">
RFC 822</A>, updated the definition of In-Reply-To: by the more modern
standard, In-Reply-To may contain only message IDs.  There will usually
be only one, but there could be more than one: these are the IDs of the
messages to which this one is a direct reply (the idea being that you
might be sending one message in reply to several others.)

</DD>

<P><DT><B>References:</B></DT>
<DD>

<P> The References header was defined by <A
HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</A> in 1982.  It
was defined in, effectively, the same way as the In-Reply-To header was
defined: which is to say, its definition was pretty useless.  (Like
In-Reply-To, its definition was also tightened up in 2001 by
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</A>.)

<P> However, the References header was <I>also</I> defined in 1987 by 
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1036.html">RFC 1036</A>
(section 2.2.5), the standard for USENET news messages.  That
definition was much tighter and more useful than the 
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</A>
definition: it asserts that this header contain a list of Message-IDs
listing the parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on, of this
message, oldest first.  That is, the direct parent of this message will
be the last element of the References header.

<P> It is not guaranteed to contain the entire tree back to the root-most
message in the thread: news readers are allowed to truncate it at their
discretion, and the manner in which they truncate it (from the front,
from the back, or from the middle) is not defined.  

<P> Therefore, while there is useful info in the References header, it
is not uncommon for multiple messages in the same thread to have
seemingly-<WBR>contradictory References data, so threading code must
make an effort to do the right thing in the face of conflicting data.

<P> <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</A>
updated the mail standard to have the same semantics of References
as the news standard,
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1036.html">RFC 1036</A>.

</DD>

</DL>

<P> In practice, if you ever see a References header in a mail message,
it will follow the
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1036.html">RFC 1036</A> (and
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</A>)
definition rather than the
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</A> definition.
Because the References header both contains more information and is
easier to parse, many modern mail user agents generate and use the
References header in mail instead of (or in addition to) In-Reply-To,
and use the USENET semantics when they do so.

<P> You will generally not see In-Reply-To in a news message, but it
can occasionally happen, usually as a result of mail/news gateways.

<P> So, any sensible threading software will have the ability to take 
both In-Reply-To and References headers into account.

<P> <B>Note:</B> 
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</A>
(section 3.6.4) says that a References field should contain the
contents of the parent message's References field, followed by the
contents of the parent's Message-ID field (in other words, the
References field should contain the path through the thread.)  However,
I've been informed that recent versions of
<A HREF="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</A> violate this
standard: they put the parent Message-ID in the In-Reply-To header, but
do not duplicate it in the References header: instead, the References
header contains the grandparent, great-grand-parent, etc.

<P> This implies that to properly reconstruct the thread of a message
in the face of this nonstandard behavior, we need to append any
In-Reply-To message IDs to References.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Algorithm</H1>

<P> This algorithm consists of five main steps, and each of those steps
is somewhat complicated.  However, once you've wrapped your brain
around it, it's not really <I>that</I> complicated, considering what it
does.

<P> In defense of its complexity, I can say this:

<UL>

<LI> This algorithm is <I>incredibly</I> robust in the face of
garbage input, and even in the face of malicious input (you cannot
construct a set of inputs that will send this algorithm into a loop,
for example.)

<P></LI><LI> This algorithm has been field-tested by something on the
order of ten million users over the course of six years.

<P></LI><LI> It really does work incredibly well.  I've never seen it
produce results that were anything less than totally reasonable.
</LI></UL>

<P> Well, enough with the disclaimers.

<P><HR WIDTH="50%"><P>

<P><B>Definitions:</B>

<UL>

<LI> A <B>Container</B> object is composed of:
 <P>

 <UL>
  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
   <TR><TD NOWRAP><TT>Message message;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </TT></TD>

      <TD NOWRAP><TT> // </TT><I>next element in sibling list, or null</I></TD></TR>
   </TABLE>
</UL>

<P></LI><LI> A <B>Message</B> object only has a few fields we are interested
  in:

 <P>
 <UL>
  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
   <TR><TD NOWRAP><TT>String subject;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </TT></TD><TD></TD></TR>
   <TR><TD NOWRAP><TT>ID message_id; </TT></TD>
      <TD NOWRAP><TT> // </TT><I>the ID of this message  </I></TD></TR>
   <TR><TD NOWRAP><TT>ID *references; </TT></TD>
      <TD NOWRAP><TT> // </TT><I>list of IDs of parent messages </I></TD></TR>
   </TABLE>
</UL>

  <P> The References field is populated from the ``References'' and/or
   ``In-Reply-To'' headers.  If both headers exist, take the first thing
   in the In-Reply-To header that looks like a Message-ID, and append it
   to the References header.

  <P> If there are multiple things in In-Reply-To that look like
   Message-IDs, only use the first one of them: odds are that the later
   ones are actually email addresses, not IDs.

  <P> These ID objects can be strings, or they can be any other token
   on which you can do meaningful equality comparisons.

  <P> Only two things need to be done with the subject strings: ask
   whether they begin with ``<TT>Re:</TT>'', and compare the non-Re
   parts for equivalence.  So you can get away with interning or
   otherwise hashing these, too.  (This is a very good idea: my code
   does this so that I can use <B>==</B> instead of <B>strcmp</B>
   inside the loop.)

  <P> The ID objects also don't need to be strings, for the same
   reason.  They can be hashes or numeric indexes or anything for
   which equality comparisons hold, so it's way faster if you can do
   pointer-equivalence comparisons instead of <B>strcmp</B>.

  <P> The reason the Container and Message objects are separate is because
   the Container fields are only needed during the act of threading:
   you don't need to keep those around, so there's no point in bulking up
   every Message structure with them.

 <P></LI><LI> The <B>id_table</B> is a hash table associating Message-IDs with
    Containers.

 <P></LI><LI> An <B>``empty container''</B> is one that doesn't have a
   message in it, but which shows evidence of having existed.  
   For whatever reason, we don't have that message in our list
   (maybe it is expired or canceled, maybe it was deleted from
   the folder, or any of several other reasons.)

   <P> At presentation-time, these will show up as unselectable ``parent''
   containers, for example, if we have the thread

   <P><PRE><B>      -- A
         |-- B
         \-- C
      -- D
</B></PRE>

   and we know about messages B and C, but their common parent A does
   not exist, there will be a placeholder for A, to group them together,
   and prevent D from seeming to be a sibling of B and C.

   <P> These ``dummy'' messages only ever occur at depth 0.

               search down the children of A to see if B is reachable.

         Now that we have the actual message, we can be more definitive,
         so throw away the old parent and use this new one.  Find this

         <P> Note that this could cause this message to now have no parent,

         as the non-first element of its references.  (Which would have
         been some kind of lie...)

                 ``<TT>RE[5]:</TT>'', ``<TT>Re: Re[4]: Re:</TT>'' and so on.
            </LI><LI>  If the subject is now &quot;&quot;, give up on this
                  Container.
            </LI><LI>  Add this Container to the <B>subject_table</B> if:
            <UL TYPE=DISC>
               <LI>  There is no container in the table with this subject, or
               </LI><LI>  This one is an empty container and the old one is not:
                  the empty one is more interesting as a root, so put it in
                  the table instead.
               </LI><LI>  The container in the table has a ``<TT>Re:</TT>''
                  version of this subject, and this container has a
                  non-``<TT>Re:</TT>'' version of
                  this subject.  The non-re version is the more interesting
                 of the two.

       </LI></UL>

     <P></LI><LI>  Now the <B>subject_table</B> is populated with one
         entry for each subject which occurs in the root set.  Now iterate
         over the root set, and gather together the difference.

         <P>For each Container in the root set:
         <P><UL TYPE=DISC>
          <LI>  Find the subject of this Container (as above.)
          </LI><LI>  Look up the Container of that subject in the table.
          </LI><LI>  If it is null, or if it is <I>this</I> container, continue.

          <P></LI><LI>  Otherwise, we want to group together this Container and
            the one in the table.  There are a few possibilities:

           <P><UL TYPE=DISC>

            <LI>  If both are dummies, append one's children to the other,
               and remove the now-empty container.

            <P></LI><LI>  If one container is a empty and the other is not, make
               the non-empty one be a child of the empty, and a sibling
               of the other ``real'' messages with the same subject (the
               empty's children.)

            <P></LI><LI>  If that container is a non-empty, and that message's
               subject does not begin with ``<TT>Re:</TT>'', but <I>this</I>
               message's subject does, then make this be a child of the other.

            <P></LI><LI>  If that container is a non-empty, and that message's
               subject begins with ``<TT>Re:</TT>'', but <I>this</I>
               message's subject does <I>not</I>, then make that be a child
               of this <NOBR>one --</NOBR> they
               were misordered.  (This happens somewhat implicitly,
               since if there are two messages, one with Re: and one
               without, the one without will be in the hash table,
               regardless of the order in which they were seen.)

            <P></LI><LI>  Otherwise, make a new empty container and make both msgs
               be a child of it.  This catches the both-are-replies and
               neither-are-replies cases, and makes them be siblings
               instead of asserting a hierarchical relationship which
               might not be true.

            <P> (People who reply to messages without using ``<TT>Re:</TT>''
               and without using a References line will break this slightly.
               Those people suck.)

         </LI></UL>

           <P> (It has occurred to me that taking the date or message number
           into account would be one way of resolving some of the
           ambiguous cases, but that's not altogether straightforward
           either.)

<P></LI><LI><B>  Now you're done threading!</B><BR>
     Specifically, you no longer need the ``parent'' slot of the
     Container object, so if you wanted to flush the data out into a
     smaller, longer-lived structure, you could reclaim some storage as
     a result.

<P></LI><LI><B>  Now, sort the siblings.</B><BR>
  At this point, the parent-child relationships are set.
  However, the sibling ordering has not been adjusted, so now is the
  time to walk the tree one last time and order the siblings by
  date, sender, subject, or whatever.  This step could also be merged
  in to the end of step 4, above, but it's probably clearer to make it
  be a final pass.  If you were careful, you could also sort the
  messages <I>first</I> and take care in the above algorithm to not
  perturb the ordering, but that doesn't really save anything.

<P><HR WIDTH="50%"><P>

<P> You might be wondering what Netscape Confusicator 4.0 broke.
Well, basically they never got threading working right.  Aside from
crashing, corrupting their databases files, and general bugginess,
the fundamental problem had been twofold:

<P><UL>
<LI> 4.0 eliminated the ``dummy thread parent'' step, which
   is an absolute necessity to get threading right in the case where
   you don't have every message (e.g., because one has expired, or
   was never sent to you at all.)  The best explanation I was able
   to get from them for why they did this was, ``it looked ugly
   and I didn't understand why it was there.''

<P></LI><LI> 4.0 eliminated the ``group similar unthreaded subjects''
   step, which is necessary to get some semblance of threading right
   in the absence of References and In-Reply-To, or in the presence
   of mangled References.  If there was no References header, 4.0
   just didn't thread at all.
</LI></UL>

<P> Plus my pet peeve,

<P><UL>

<LI> The 4.0 UI presented threading as a kind of sorting, which is
   just not the case.  Threading is the act of presenting parent/child
   relationships, whereas sorting is the act of ordering siblings.


  <P> That is, 4.0 gives you these choices: ``Sort by Date; Sort by
  Subject; Sort by message number; or Thread.''  Where they assume that
  ``Thread'' implies ``Sort by Date.''   So that means that there's 
  no way to see a threaded set of messages that are sorted by message
  number, or by sender, etc.

  <P> There should be options for how to sort the messages; and then,
  orthogonal to that should be the boolean option of whether the messages
  should be threaded.  

</LI></UL>

<P> I seem to recall there being some other problem that was a result
of the thread hierarchy being stored in the database, instead of
computed as needed in realtime (there were was some kind of ordering or
stale-data issue that came up?) but maybe they finally managed to fix
that.  

<P> My C version of this code was able to thread 10,000 messages in
less than half a second on a low-end <NOBR>(90 MHz)</NOBR> Pentium, so
the argument that it has to be in the database for efficiency is pure
bunk.

<P> Also bunk is the idea that databases are needed for
``scalability.''  This code can thread 100,000 messages without a
horrible delay, and the fact is, if you're looking at a 100,000 message
folder (or for that matter, if you're <I>running Confusicator at
all</I>), you're doing so on a machine that has sufficient memory to
hold these structures in core.  Also consider the question of whether
your GUI toolkit contains a list/outliner widget that can display a
million elements in the first place.  (The answer is probably ``no.'')
Also consider whether you have ever in your life seen a single folder
that has a million messages in it, and that further, you've wanted to look
at all at once (rather than <I>only</I> looking at the most recent 100,000
messages to arrive in that newsgroup...)

<P> In short, all the arguments I've heard for using databases to
implement threading and <A HREF="mailsum.html">mbox summarization</A>
are solving problems that simply don't exist.  Show me a real-world
situation where the above technique actually falls down, and then we'll
talk.

<P> Just say no to databases!
